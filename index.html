                    <h2>About me:</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was born in Canada during 1980. When I was young I got
                        quickly addicted to computers. Life, however, took it's
                        own turn and I didn't get anywhere into the computer
                        market that I had planned when I was younger. For the
                        past 20+ years I've been working as a cook but as
                        COVID-19 recently hit the world over, I decided to take
                        control of myself and used the time off work to learn a
                        new skill and start working in the field I was always
                        interested in but never had the resources to achieve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also always wanted to work for myself, and with the
                        way the world is these days, working remotely from home
                        seems like a good idea that will allow me to achieve a
                        steady finacial flow, keep from spreading COVID-19, and
                        give back to a community and technology I've loved for
                        so long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In September 2020, I enrolled myself into a few courses
                        on the
                        <a href="www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> learning platform, one
                        of which was Web Developer. I've also taken extra
                        courses in JavaScript, NodeJS, and MongoDB. I also plan
                        on taking courses in Python and Java, and if my cards
                        play right I'd like to get into Mobile Development.
